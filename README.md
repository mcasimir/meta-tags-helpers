# Rails meta tags helpers

## Seo and future-proof meta tags for Rails

The `meta-tags-helpers` gem consists of a set of helpers to setup and render html meta tags in a simple way. It has good customizable defaults that also come with built-in support for open-graph and csrf: all your meta tags in a single call.

Supports both Rails 3 and 4.

### Install

``` rb
gem 'meta-tags-helpers', '~> 0.2.0'
```

### Examples

You could use the default meta tags (see below) inserting the following snippet of `erb` code in your layout.

``` erb
<%= meta_tags %>
```

if you don't like the defaults you can override them passing other values as a parameter to the `meta_tags` helper.


``` erb
<%= meta_tags(
    :title => "MyBlog - This is a Blog",
    :description => "My blog description & a reserved character that will be escaped",
    :og => {:type => "website"}
    :ns => {
      :my_custom_meta => "a value"
    }
    )
%>
```

if you would like to skip any default tag from being rendered, declare it as `:skip => "title"` or as `:skip => ["title", "description"]`.

``` erb
<%= meta_tags(
    :title => "MyBlog - This is a Blog",
    :description => "My blog description & a reserved character that will be escaped",
    :og => {:type => "website"}
    :ns => {
      :my_custom_meta => "a value"
    }
    )
%>
```
You can further override these values in your controller, views and partials using the `set_meta` method (see below).

### Generated HTML

The first example above will produce the following html:

``` html
<meta name="charset" content="utf-8" />
<meta name="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
<title>MyBlog - This is a Blog</title>
<meta property="description" content="The blog of mine &amp; a reserved character" />
<meta property="og:url" content="(THE CURRENT REQUESTED URL)" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="MyBlog - This is a Blog" />
<meta property="og:description" content="The blog of mine &amp; a reserved character" />
<meta property="ns:my_custom_meta" content="a value" />
<meta name="csrf-param" content="..." />
<meta name="csrf-token" content="..." />

```

### Namespaced Keys

Metas with namespaced keys (eg. `og:title`) are supposed to be RDF properties and so they are rendered using a `property` attribute.

You can equally set namespaced keys through simple key-value pairs (eg. `:"og:type" => "..."`) or with nested hashes (eg. `:og => {:type => "..."}`).

Note that you can also easily render arrays of metas having the same key passing an array as value.

``` rhtml
<%= meta_tags(
    :title => "Escape from New York",
    :description => "Sci-fi film by John Carpenter"
    :og => {
      :type => "video.movie"
    },
    :video => {
      :year => 1981,
      :actor => ["Kurt Russell", "Lee Van Cleef"]
    })
%>
```

### Setting and overriding meta tags from controller/partials/other views

You can set any meta tag from controller, partials or views via the `set_meta` method:

``` rhtml
<!-- application.html.erb: the global settings -->
<%= meta_tags :og => { :type => "website" } %>
```

Override it in a controller:

``` rb
def show
   set_meta "og:type"   => "article"
end
```
In a view:

``` rhtml
  <% set_meta "og:type" => "article" %>
```

**NOTE:** `set_meta(:og => { :type => "article" })` is exactly the same of `set_meta(:"og:type" => "article")` so they will both override the current/default `og:type` meta tag.

You can also customize and read some of defautls (see below) through handy helpers within controllers or views:

``` rb
meta_title(value = nil)
meta_description(value = nil)
meta_image(value = nil)
meta_type(value = nil)

```

### Defaults

This is the default options hash:

``` rb
default   = {
  :charset           => "utf-8",
  :"X-UA-Compatible" => "IE=edge,chrome=1",
  :viewport          => "width=device-width",
  :"og:url"          => "#{request.url}",
  :"og:type"         => "article",
  :"og:title"        => opts[:title],
  :"og:description"  => opts[:description],
  :"og:image"        => opts[:"og:image"],
  :"csrf-param"      => request_forgery_protection_token,
  :"csrf-token"      => form_authenticity_token
}

```

**NOTE:** You should supply at least the `title` and the `description`, using `set_meta` or directly as `meta_tags` argument.
